# hefty

an heft-y implementation of the heft cpu scheduler algorithm based on the paper -

[_Performance-effective and low-complexity task scheduling for heterogeneous computing_
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/993206?denied=)
## Getting Started

### Running the program


run the makefile with the make command

```console
make
```
then run (change based on input file)
```console
hefty input01.txt
```
this will give you the ranks of the data and graphs

to clean the files
```console
make clean
```
